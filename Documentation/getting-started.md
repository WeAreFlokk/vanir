# Getting started

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 14 or greater

## Creating a new application

It all starts with an [application](./concepts.md).

Navigate to the root of the project / repository you want to host your monorepo based microservice solution:

```shell
$ yarn create dolittle-app <Name of app>
```

For details on what a portal is, read more [here](./concepts.md#Portal).

## Creating a new microservice

Once you have an application you can create a microservice from the same location:

```shell
$ yarn create dolittle-microservice <Name of microservice>
```

Follow the questions and you should have a microservice added.
