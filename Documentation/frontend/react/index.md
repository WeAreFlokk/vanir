# React

Vanir supports React out of the box.

The main goal for the React support is to give you a great experience for composing
microservices into a larger application container. With it comes things like routing.

Another aspect is to put the developers in the pit of success in terms of maintainable
code over time. One of the main things Vanir brings to the
table is the support for [MVVM - Model View ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel),
an architectural pattern that is designed to give good separation of concerns.

In addition to this, you'll also find other reusable utilities that is aimed to help
you.
