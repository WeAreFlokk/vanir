# Frontend

The main goal of Vanir from a frontend perspective is to make it easier to do
composition of microservices and their frontends.
To do this one needs to look at how to compose together things, but also deal with
routing, deep linking and ability for composed parts to communicate in a decoupled manner.

Vanir has a few built in helpers and utilities to make these things easier and
is expected to grow over time as we discover new needs and patterns.
