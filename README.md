In Norse mythology, the Vanir are a group of gods associated with health, fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future.

This repository is similar in the way that it is a group of packages offering a sane combination of technologies and packages
put together to bring fertility and wisdom into projects.

The project serves as a combination of packages that we have found useful. In addition to this, we've put in the necessary
glue when needed to make them work together.

The goal is to provide a good starting point when creating applications and Dolittle based microservices.

## Not a framework

It is vital to not look at this as a framework of any sort that owns its own concepts. Look at it as a springboard for
projects with what we believe are sane combinations of technologies. There are also some interesting tools within here
that stand on their own.

To set expectations even further; this is not core technology at Dolittle but serves an interest for Dolittle internally
while building things like our [Studio](https://github.com/dolittle/studio). The projects in this repository are only maintained
for this sole purpose in mind. In addition we do use these projects with customers and contributions are then also coming from these
projects.
